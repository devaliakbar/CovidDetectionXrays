# Covid Pneumonia Detection using X-rays

This repository contains a project for detecting Covid Pneumonia from X-ray images.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local development environment.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with Jupyter Notebook. Additionally, make sure to install the required packages such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and others.

3. **Prepare the Dataset:** Run the Jupyter Notebook named `SetupDataset.ipynb` to set up and preprocess the dataset.

4. **Training Models:**
- If you want to train the models, run `ReTrain.ipynb` and `ScratchTrain.ipynb`.
- Alternatively, you can download pre-trained models from [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T4u6H-krXtReFYQwYSd4YGNpJFqifaU4] and create a folder named 'OUTPUT' in the project directory. Place the downloaded models into this folder.

5. **Evaluate Models:** Run the Jupyter Notebook named `EvaluateModels.ipynb` to evaluate the performance of the trained models.
